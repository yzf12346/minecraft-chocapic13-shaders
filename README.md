# Agreement

This shader pack is being developed based upon Chocapic13's Shaders, adhering to the following quoted agreement:

Sharing a modified version of my shaders:
 * You are not allowed to claim any of the code included in "Chocapic13' shaders" as your own
 * You can share a modified version of my shaders if you respect the following title scheme : " -Name of the shaderpack- (Chocapic13' Shaders edit) "
 * You cannot use any monetizing links (for example adfoc.us ; adf.ly)
 * The rules of modification and sharing have to be same as the one here (copy paste all these rules in your post and change depending if you allow modification or not), you cannot make your own rules, you can only choose if you allow redistribution.
 * I have to be clearly credited
 * You cannot use any version older than "Chocapic13' Shaders V4" as a base, however you can modify older versions for personal use
 * Common sense : if you want a feature from another shaderpack or want to use a piece of code found on the web, make sure the code is open source. In doubt ask the creator.
 * Common sense #2 : share your modification only if you think it adds something really useful to the shaderpack(not only 2-3 constants changed)
